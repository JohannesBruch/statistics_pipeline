# statistics_pipeline
The statistics_pipeline file helps you to execute the functions in the other files in a sensible order.

# compile_results
Opens the result files of parallel runs and combines them to a result summary in a matrix.

# plot_accuracies
Plots the mean accuracies after each epoch for the methods that you specify.

# corrected_t_test
following Bouckaert and Frank 2004 'Evaluating the Replicability of Significance Tests for Comparing Learning Algorithms' 10.1007/978-3-540-24775-3_3, but without repetitions and with epochs, we test whether the difference between accuracies of two algorithms is significant.
